# PandocRefeqMathml - ad hoc tool to modify pandoc-converted MathML from LaTeX

## Summary

This Ruby command-line command modifies a MathML file converted with `pandoc`
from LaTeX.

Whereas `pandoc` is a great text-ish file converter, there are a few caveats,
at the time of writing, in converting a LaTeX file to MathML.

A major caveat is the generated MathML does not display the equation numbers
that are auto-generated by LaTeX in default for the `equation` and `eqnarray`
environments, nor their (LaTeX) labels. All the (LaTeX) `ref` remain as they
are, which is a coded message for readers.

Another caveat is the alignments of equations in the `eqnarray` environment.

This tool is a bit of ad hoc (dirty) hack to correct these points *in some
basic situations*.  "Basic" here means just the standard LaTeX commands, not
some external package-specific commands.

The full package of this module is found in [PandocRefeqMathml Ruby Gems page](http://rubygems.org/gems/pandoc_refeq_mathml) (with document created
from source annotation with yard) and in
[Github](https://github.com/masasakano/pandoc_refeq_mathml)

## Background and constraints

Pandoc-converted MathML.html from LaTeX lacks equation numbers that are
present in the original LaTeX.  The
[pandoc-crossref](https://github.com/lierdakil/pandoc-crossref) offers a way
to tackle the problem; however its fix is far from perfect with three or four
major caveats.

1.  A single number is assigned to the whole set of equations in an `eqnarray`
    environment, which is inconsistent with LaTeX.
2.  The LaTeX `\nonumber` is not taken into account.
3.  Referencing text to an equation displays the original LaTeX label, as
    opposed to the equation number, which makes no sense to readers.
4.  Because of points (1) and (2), the given equation numbers usually do not
    agree at all with the original document compiled by LaTeX.


In LaTeX, you may reference equation 1 and 3 in a single `eqnarray`
environment separately. However, because of point (1), it would not be
possible in pandoc-generated MathML.  Besides, since they are not referenced
with equation numbers in the MathML (point 3) in the first place.

This tool (command-line command) offers a way to fix these problems, albeit in
a crude way. The command adds equation numbers that are guessed from the text
in the annotation fields in `<math>` and LaTeX aux file (the latter of which
is automatically generated as a byproduct when you compile a LaTeX document). 
Not all the numbers are recovered but only those that are referenced somewhere
in the MathML file.

(Note that in principle, it should not be too difficult to modify the program
so that all the labelled equations in LaTeX are labelled again in MathML. 
Nevertheless, it would be tricky to label equations that are not explicitly
labelled in LaTeX because implicit numbering information is not available in
the LaTeX aux file.)

The algorithm assumes a LaTeX standard aux file-format, the MathML having a
link tag `<a>` with the attributes "data-reference-type=ref" and href to the
label of the exact reference label in LaTeX (and the label should have no
duplicates in the MathML) and also having the `'annotation[ encoding="application/x-tex"]'` tag in each math tag containing the original
LaTeX code. The LaTeX code must have either the standard "equation" or
"eqnarray" structures associated with the standard "label" tag with a simple
content (if it contains, apart from the label string, something more than
preceding or trailing white spaces, such as a comment, this algorithm would
likely fail).  If equations in an eqnarray environment have complicated nested
structures like a matrix, I do not know how the algorithm of this routine
handles them.  Also, the LaTeX section numbering must be combinations of
Arabic numbers, full-stops, and maybe capital letters (for Appendix) only.

Essentially, LaTeX has a huge amount of freedom and so I am afraid it would be
a somewhat futile effort to deal with every possibility...

### Output MathML by pandoc-2.19 converted from LaTeX

Ordinary LaTeX inline maths expressions (e.g., `$5^2$`) are expressed as
follows:

```html
<math display="inline" xmlns="http://w..."><semantics>
 <mrow><mn>5</mn><mi>π</mi></mrow>
 <annotation encoding="application/x-tex">5\pi</annotation>
</semantics></math>
```

LaTeX's `begin{equation}` is as follows (n.b., the `<p>` tag may not be closed
immediately after `</math>` but another ordinary sentences may follow):

```html
<p><math display="block" xmlns="http://w..."><semantics>
 <mrow><mi>x</mi><mo>±</mo><mi>ϵ</mi></mrow></mrow>
 <annotation encoding="application/x-tex">x \pm \epsilon \label{my_xe}</annotation>
</semantics></math>
```

LaTeX's `begin{eqnarray}` is as follows:

```html
<p><math display="block" xmlns="http://w..."><semantics><mtable>
 <mtr><mtd columnalign="right"><mrow><mn>1</mn><mo>+</mo><mi>x</mi></mrow></mtd>
      <mtd columnalign="left"><mo>=</mo></mtd>
      <mtd columnalign="right"><mrow><mn>1</mn><mo>−</mo><mi>x</mi></mrow></mtd></mtr>
 <mtr><mtd columnalign="right"></mtd>
      <mtd columnalign="left"><mo>=</mo></mtd>
      <mtd columnalign="right"><mfrac><mn>2</mn><mrow><mn>1</mn><mi>x</mi></mrow></mfrac></mtd></mtr>
 </mtable><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\begin{aligned}
  1+x &amp; = &amp; 1-x \nonumber\\
      &amp; = &amp; \frac{2}{1x} \label{eq_trivial}
  \end{aligned}</annotation></semantics></math></p>
```

They are referred to as from another text follows:

```html
<p>Eq.<a href="#eq_trivial" data-reference-type="ref"
   data-reference="eq_trivial">[eq_trivial]</a> was easy...
```

### Algorithm

For fixing the alignments to follow the standard eqnarray alignments (right,
centre, and left in this order), the program searches for `<mtable>` and
rewrites the `columnalign` attributes in the `<mtd>` tags.

For fixing the equation numbers and links, the program

1.  first reads a LaTeX aux file and lists all the labels for equations and
    their numbers.
2.  Then, it picks up an internally-pointing HTML anchor,
3.  matches it with the list generated from the LaTeX aux file and identifies
    the equation number,
4.  searches labels in `<annotation>` tags for the identical string for the
    HTML/MathML-anchor,
5.  identifies the exact equation corresponding to the label (if in the
    eqnarray environment),
6.  inserts the identified equation number next to the MathML equation,
7.  and finally modifies the plain text for the HTML anchor.


Each of the inserted equation number next to the corresponding equation is
inside the `<mtext>` tags. In `<mtable>` (for LaTeX `eqnarray{}`), it is
inserted as a new `<mtd>` cell. In both cases, the text is right-aligned with
some padding to the left.  However, the position is relative to either the
equation or the set of the equations that contains the relevant equation (for
LaTeX `eqnarray{}`) and is not like the original LaTeX, where equation numbers
inside a pair of parentheses are always located at the right edge of a page in
default.

## How to use the command

Once you have installed it according to the standard RubyGems procedure (see
section Install), the main Ruby executable (command) `pandoc_refeq_mathml`
should be in your command-search path.

It basically reads a MathML file from either the first command-line argument
or STDIN and also a LaTeX aux file specified in a command-line, and then
outputs the modified (corrected) MathML to STDOUT.

Any warnings are printed to either STDERR or a log-file specified in a
command-line as an option.

Failure in matching the labels from an HTML tag with any of the MathML
equations are printed as a warning (to STDERR in default). Although it may
genuinely mean the non-existent labels in the original LaTeX source, it is far
more likely that the labels belong to one of the sections (or tables of
figures), because the algorithm cannot tell what the type (section, table,
figure, or equation or else) of each label's origin is.

### Help doc

The help doc for the command-line interface is displayed with `-h` (or
`--help`) option:

```sh
% pandoc_refeq_mathml -h
Usage: pandoc_refeq_mathml [options] [--] [MathML.html] > STDOUT
       pandoc_refeq_mathml [options] [--] < STDIN > STDOUT

Description (Version=0.1):
   This fixes issues, label-references of equations and eqnarray alignments, of pandoc-converted MathML from LaTeX.

Specific options:
    -a, --aux [FILENAME]             (mandatory) LaTeX aux filename
        --log [FILENAME]             Log filename (Default: STDERR). /dev/null to disable it.
        --[no-]fixalign              Fix eqnarray-alignment problems? (Def: true)
    -v, --[no-]verbose               Run verbosely (Def: true)

Common options:
    -h, --help                       Show this message
        --version                    Show version
```

### Examples

```sh
% pandoc_refeq_mathml --aux=mydoc.aux --log=error.log mydoc.html > revised1.html
% head -n 90 mydoc.html | pandoc_refeq_mathml --aux=mydoc.aux --no-fixalign > revised2.html
```

Also, in the `test/data/` directory, there is a sample LaTeX file. You can run
`make` in the directory to generate and correct a HTML/MathML file.  Read the
comment in the `Makefile` to see options, such as the LaTeX executable in your
environment.

## Install

Standard Ruby-gem install procedure is suffice

```sh
% gem install pandoc_refeq_mathml
```

which should also install the dependant  [Nokogiri gem](https://rubygems.org/gems/nokogiri/).

Alternatively, it is possible to download the library file
`lib/pandoc_refeq_mathml.rb` somewhere in your local directory, set the
environmental variable `RUBYLIB` to also point to the directory for the
library, and execute 

```sh
% ruby bin/pandoc_refeq_mathml
```

where `ruby` is optional.  Note that [Nokogiri gem](https://rubygems.org/gems/nokogiri/) must be available in your RUBY
library path.

In the developer's environment [diff-lcs gem](https://rubygems.org/gems/diff-lcs) is also required.

This tool requires [Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org) Version 2.0 or above.

## Developer's note

The source code is maintained also in
[Github](https://github.com/masasakano/pandoc_refeq_mathml) with no intuitive
interface for annotations.

### Tests

The Ruby codes under the directory `test/` are the test scripts. You can run
them from the top directory as `ruby test/test_****.rb` or simply run `make
test` or `rake test`.

## Known bugs and ToDo items

*   pandoc-generated HTMLs do not contain Table/Figure numbers in their
    `<caption>`, even though each anchored text refers to the corresponding
    number, such as, `see Table "2"`, where "2" is the anchor.
*   In fact, pandoc-generated HTMLs do not generate `<figure>` tags, let alone
    `<figurecaption>` for the LaTeX figure environments that contain more than
    one figure (with `\includegraphics`)...
